### Assignment 1
A program that implements a (batch) linear regression using the gradient
descent method in Python 3. The program accepts the following parameters:

1. threshold - The threshold, that the change in error has to fall below, before the
algorithm terminates.
2. data - The location of the data file (e.g. /media/data/yacht.csv).
3. eta - The learning rate of the gradient descent approach.
