### Assignment 1
A program that implements a (batch) linear regression using the gradient
descent method in Python 3. The program accepts the following parameters:

1. threshold - The threshold, that the change in error has to fall below, before the
algorithm terminates.
2. data - The location of the data file (e.g. /media/data/yacht.csv).
3. eta - The learning rate of the gradient descent approach.

### Assignment 2
A program that implements a simple sigmoid neural network using the delta rule.Given are the two data sets named Gauss3 and Gauss4 as csv files. My program is  able to read both data sets and treat the last value of each line as the class (1 being
positive and 0 being negative). Implemented the backpropagation
algorithm with single sample correction (means updating the
weights every data point).
